# SmartInverGenHub  

**SmartInverGenHub** is an advanced embedded system designed to optimize generator control, monitor fuel levels, manage power metrics, and ensure seamless communication with remote servers. This README outlines the initial features and requirements being implemented.  

## Features  

### Generator Power Monitoring  
1. **Power Data**: Collect and report key power metrics related to generator operation.  
2. **Source Timings**: Record start and end times of each power source to calculate running durations.  
3. **Frequency-Based Alarms**:  
   - Over-frequency alert.  
   - Overload detection.  
   - Phase loss notification.  

### Fuel Management  
1. **Fuel Level**: Report fuel levels as a percentage.  
2. **Fuel Consumption**: Monitor and report fuel consumption as a percentage.  
3. **Refueling Events**: Log the start and end times of each refueling event for detailed reports.  

### Battery Monitoring  
1. **Charging Timings**: Record the start time of charging cycles.  
2. **Discharging Timings**: Record the start time of discharging cycles.  

### Data Transmission  
The system will send the following data to a remote server for centralized monitoring:  
- **Generator Status**: Real-time operational data.  
- **Alarms**: Notifications for frequency issues, overloads, and phase loss.  
- **Fuel Information**: Levels, consumption, and refueling logs.  
- **Battery Data**: Charging and discharging cycle information.  

### Configuration  
- System settings can be configured remotely using SMS commands for ease of use.  

## Upcoming Enhancements  
- Advanced analytics for predictive maintenance.  
- Integration with renewable energy sources for hybrid setups.  
- Mobile and web applications for real-time monitoring.  

**SmartInverGenHub**: Where intelligence meets efficiency in power and fuel management. ðŸš€
